# "Student Marks Prediction"
A machine learning application built using Python and scikit-learn.

## Description
Student Marks Prediction is a tool designed to forecast students' marks based on various features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, and scores in math, reading, and writing. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this application aims to provide accurate predictions that can help students understand their academic standing and identify areas for improvement.

## Features
- Gender: The gender of the student.
- Race/Ethnicity: The racial or ethnic group the student belongs to.
- Parental Level of Education: The highest level of education attained by the student's parents.
- Lunch: Type of lunch the student receives (e.g., standard or free/reduced).
- Test Preparation Course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course or not.
- Math Score: The student's score in the math exam.
- Reading Score: The student's score in the reading exam.
- Writing Score: The student's score in the writing exam.


## Usage
The application uses these features to train a machine-learning model that can predict students' future marks. By inputting the relevant data, users can get predictions that help them make informed decisions about their study strategies and identify which areas need more focus.
